Overview 
--------

* System Specification 

The full specification of the type system shown in Section 7.1 is in the file
Qualitative_ott.v. This file has been mechanically generated from the Ott
specification, but then slightly edited. For convenience, we also provide the
file spec.pdf that contains a typeset version of the system, also generated
from the same specification file.

* Assumptions (axioms)
  - lemmas about substitution generated by LNgen tool (Qualitative_inf.v)
  - local closure properties of all relations (see tactics.v)
  - abstract properties of the lattice (grade_sig.v)
    

Compilation Instructions
-----------------------

Installation and Compilation Instructions
This development has been tested with The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.10.2 

To compile this code with Coq, you also need to install a copy of the Metalib library. This library is available from https://github.com/plclub/metalib at the coq8.10 tag.

This directory includes a Coq specification of a dependently typed calculus with type-in-type, dependent functions, unit, products and sums.

Once Coq and metalib have been installed, the files can be compiled using

      make coq

You may also be able to install via OPAM:

     opam switch create ./ OCAML_VERSION
     opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
     opam install coq coq-ott ott
     opam pin add coq-metalib https://github.com/plclub/metalib.git
